  We propose TwinLiteNet+, an efficient and accurate semantic segmentation model tailored for autonomous driving tasks like drivable area and lane segmentation. With significantly reduced computational cost and strong performance across multiple configurations, TwinLiteNet+ outperforms existing SOTA models while being highly suitable for embedded deployment.
