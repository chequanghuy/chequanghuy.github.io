abstract: >-
  FA-Seg is a fast and training-free diffusion-based framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that segments all classes in a single (1+1)-step process. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (43.8% mIoU) across multiple benchmarks by introducing dual-prompt attention extraction, hierarchical attention refinement, and test-time flipping for improved precision and efficiency.
