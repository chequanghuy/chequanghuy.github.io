  We propose ASCUL, an adaptive clustering-based unsupervised learning method that dynamically adjusts clustering hyperparameters and representation mining to address issues caused by shrinking cluster density. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASCUL achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised person re-ID methods.
